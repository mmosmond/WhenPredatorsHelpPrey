  abstract =      {Causal attribution of recent biological trends to
                   climate change is complicated because non-climatic
                   influences dominate local, short-term biological
                   changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is
                   likely to be revealed by analyses that seek
                   systematic trends across diverse species and
                   geographic regions; however, debates within the
                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
                   reveal several definitions of a 'systematic trend'.
                   Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse
                   analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that
                   recent biological trends match climate change
                   predictions. Global meta-analyses documented
                   significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade
                   towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and
                   significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3
                   days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint
                   of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses
                   uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate
                   trends. Among appropriate
                   long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this
                   diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species.
                   This suite of analyses generates 'very high
                   confidence' (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate
                   change is already affecting living systems.},

  abstract =      {The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological
                   effects of climate change is whether species will be
                   able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their
                   changing environment. If we establish the maximal
                   rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to
                   the rate at which temperatures can increase without
                   loss of biodiversity. The rate of adaptation will
                   primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since
                   (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as
                   reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence
                   microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii)
                   learning will be favourable to the individual but
                   cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii)
                   maternal effects may play a role but, as with other
                   forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of
                   offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be
                   adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv)
                   adaptation via immigration of individuals with
                   genotypes adapted to warmer environments also
                   involves microevolution as these genotypes are better
                   adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of,
                   for instance, photoperiod.Long-term studies on wild
                   populations with individually known animals play an
                   essential role in detecting and understanding the
                   temporal trends in life-history traits, and to
                   estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures
                   on, life-history traits. However, additional
                   measurements on other trophic levels and on the
                   mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are
                   needed to predict the rate of microevolution,
                   especially under changing conditions. Using this
                   knowledge on heritability of, and selection on,
                   life-history traits, in combination with climate
                   scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of
                   adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final
                   step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to
                   make the link to population viability and from there
                   to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the
                   rate of adaptation is insufficient.},

                   dramatic changes in phenology of plants and animals,
                   with optimal timing of reproduction advancing
                   considerably in the northern hemisphere. However,
                   some species may not have advanced their timing of
                   breeding sufficiently to continue reproducing
                   optimally relative to the occurrence of peak food
                   availability, thus becoming mismatched compared with
                   their food sources. The degree of mismatch may differ
                   among species, and species with greater mismatch may
                   be characterized by declining populations. Here we
                   relate changes in spring migration timing by 100
                   European bird species since 1960, considered as an
                   index of the phenological response of bird species to
                   recent climate change, to their population trends.
                   Species that declined in the period 1990-2000 did not
                   advance their spring migration, whereas those with
                   stable or increasing populations advanced their
                   migration considerably. On the other hand, population
                   trends during 1970-1990 were predicted by breeding
                   habitat type, northernmost breeding latitude, and
                   winter range (with species of agricultural habitat,
                   breeding at northern latitudes, and wintering in
                   Africa showing an unfavorable conservation status),
                   but not by change in migration timing. The
                   association between population trend in 1990-2000 and
                   change in migration phenology was not confounded by
                   any of the previously identified predictors of
                   population trends in birds, or by similarity in
                   phenotype among taxa due to common descent. Our
                   findings imply that ecological factors affecting
                   population trends can change over time and suggest
                   that ongoing climatic changes will increasingly
                   threaten vulnerable migratory bird species,
                   augmenting their extinction risk.},

                   to increase with latitude, paralleling increases in
                   warming. However, the magnitude of impacts depends
                   not only on the degree of warming but also on the
                   number of species at risk, their physiological
                   sensitivity to warming and their options for
                   behavioural and physiological compensation. Lizards
                   are useful for evaluating risks of warming because
                   their thermal biology is well studied. We conducted
                   macrophysiological analyses of diurnal lizards from
                   diverse latitudes plus focal species analyses of
                   Puerto Rican Anolis and Sphaerodactyus. Although
                   tropical lowland lizards live in environments that
                   are warm all year, macrophysiological analyses
                   indicate that some tropical lineages
                   (thermoconformers that live in forests) are active at
                   low body temperature and are intolerant of warm
                   temperatures. Focal species analyses show that some
                   tropical forest lizards were already experiencing
                   stressful body temperatures in summer when studied
                   several decades ago. Simulations suggest that warming
                   will not only further depress their physiological
                   performance in summer, but will also enable
                   warm-adapted, open-habitat competitors and predators
                   to invade forests. Forest lizards are key components
                   of tropical ecosystems, but appear vulnerable to the
                   cascading physiological and ecological effects of
                   climate warming, even though rates of tropical
                   warming may be relatively low.},

                   Predicting the effects of future ocean warming on
                   biogeochemical cycles depends critically on
                   understanding how existing global temperature
                   variation affects phytoplankton. Here we show that
                   variation in phytoplankton temperature optima over
                   150 degrees of latitude is well explained by a
                   gradient in mean ocean temperature. An
                   eco-evolutionary model predicts a similar
                   relationship, suggesting that this pattern is the
                   result of evolutionary adaptation. Using mechanistic
                   species distribution models, we find that rising
                   temperatures this century will cause poleward shifts
                   in species' thermal niches and a sharp decline in

                   Climate change may lead to alterations in both
                   abiotic and biotic components of selection. Although
                   there is evidence that abundant genetic variation

                   variation for key characters determining distribution
                   and abundance. Moreover, climate change can affect
                   nonselective components of microevolution, such as
                   genetic variances and covariances, and the magnitudes

                   selection pressures on traits important for fitness,
                   and therefore, microevolution in response to
                   climate-mediated selection is potentially an
                   important mechanism mitigating negative consequences
                   of climate change. We reviewed the empirical evidence
                   for recent microevolutionary responses to climate
                   change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the
                   following three perspectives emerging from the
                   published data. First, although signatures of climate
                   change are clearly visible in many ecological
                   processes, similar examples of microevolutionary
                   responses in literature are in fact very rare.
                   Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary
                   responses to climate change is far from satisfactory
                   as the documented responses are often - if not
                   typically - based on nongenetic data. We reinforce
                   the view that it is as important to make the
                   distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and
                   phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component)
                   responses clear, as it is to understand the relative
                   roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to
                   climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the
                   difficulties and their potential ubiquity in
                   detection of microevolution in response to natural
                   selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic
                   studies on microevolutionary responses to natural
                   selection in the context of long-term studies of
                   vertebrates. The available evidence points to the
                   overall conclusion that many responses perceived as
                   adaptations to changing environmental conditions
                   could be environmentally induced plastic responses
                   rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence,
                   clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for
                   evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is
                   conspicuously scarce.},

                   change, which requires micro-evolutionary change in
                   the long term. A key question is how the rate of this
                   micro-evolutionary change compares with the rate of
                   environmental change, given that theoretically there
                   is a 'critical rate of environmental change' beyond
                   which increased maladaptation leads to population
                   extinction. Here, we parametrize two closely related
                   models to predict this critical rate using data from
                   a long-term study of great tits (Parus major). We
                   used stochastic dynamic programming to predict
                   changes in optimal breeding time under three
                   different climate scenarios. Using these results we
                   parametrized two theoretical models to predict
                   critical rates. Results from both models agreed
                   qualitatively in that even 'mild' rates of climate
                   change would be close to these critical rates with
                   respect to great tit breeding time, while for
                   scenarios close to the upper limit of IPCC climate
                   projections the calculated critical rates would be
                   clearly exceeded with possible consequences for
                   population persistence. We therefore tentatively
                   conclude that micro-evolution, together with
                   plasticity, would rescue only the population from
                   mild rates of climate change, although the models
                   make many simplifying assumptions that remain to be
                   tested.},

                   is one of the biggest challenges that ecologists
                   face. Predictions routinely focus on the direct
                   effects of climate change on individual species, yet
                   interactions between species can strongly influence
                   how climate change affects organisms at every scale

                   change strongly rely on projecting altered
                   environmental conditions on species distributions.
                   However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate
                   change also influences species interactions. We
                   review and synthesize literature information on
                   biotic interactions and use it to argue that the
                   abundance of species and the direction of selection
                   during climate change vary depending on how their
                   trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant
                   abundance can be controlled by aboveground and
                   belowground multitrophic level interactions with
                   herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies.
                   We discuss how these interactions may alter during
                   climate change and the resulting species range
                   shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between
                   species responses to climate warming and exotic
                   species introduced in new ranges. There are also
                   important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and
                   mutualistic symbionts of range-expanding species and
                   their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene
                   flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the
                   expansion zone of range expanders different from that
                   of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that
                   under climate change, results of altered species
                   interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming
                   rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these
                   possibilities into account will provide a new
                   perspective on predicting species distribution under

                   environments typically consider single species or
                   perhaps pairs of interacting species. However, all
                   organisms co-occur with many other species, resulting
                   in evolutionary dynamics that might not match those
                   predicted using single species approaches. Recent
                   theories predict that species interactions in diverse
                   systems can influence how component species evolve in
                   response to environmental change. In turn, evolution
                   might have consequences for ecosystem functioning. We
                   used experimental communities of five bacterial
                   species to show that species interactions have a
                   major impact on adaptation to a novel environment in
                   the laboratory. Species in communities diverged in
                   their use of resources compared with the same species
                   in monocultures and evolved to use waste products
                   generated by other species. This generally led to a
                   trade-off between adaptation to the abiotic and
                   biotic components of the environment, such that
                   species evolving in communities had lower growth
                   rates when assayed in the absence of other species.
                   Based on growth assays and on nuclear magnetic
                   resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of resource use, all
                   species evolved more in communities than they did in
                   monocultures. The evolutionary changes had
                   significant repercussions for the functioning of
                   these experimental ecosystems: communities
                   reassembled from isolates that had evolved in
                   polyculture were more productive than those
                   reassembled from isolates that had evolved in
                   monoculture. Our results show that the way in which
                   species adapt to new environments depends critically
                   on the biotic environment of co-occurring species.
                   Moreover, predicting how functioning of complex
                   ecosystems will respond to an environmental change
                   requires knowing how species interactions will

                   theory about the dynamics and stability of both

                   how predatory and anti-predator traits should respond
                   to environmental changes. Evolution can stabilize or
                   destabilize interactions; stability is most likely
                   when only the predator evolves, or when traits in one
                   or both species are under strong stabilizing
                   selection. Stability seems least likely when there is

                   decrease offensive and defensive adaptations. The
                   apparent predominance of evolutionary responses of
                   prey to predators over those of predators to prey is
                   in general accord with equilibrium theory, but theory

                   are found with a diversity of predators in the lower
                   reaches of streams, but few predators in the
                   headwaters. These differences have caused the
                   adaptive evolution of guppy behaviour, morphology,
                   male colouration and life history. Waterfalls often
                   serve as barriers to the upstream distribution of
                   predators and/or guppies. Such discontinuities make
                   it possible to treat streams like giant test tubes by
                   introducing guppies or predators to small segments of
                   streams from which they were previously excluded.
                   Such experiments enable us to document how fast
                   evolution can occur and the fine spatial scales over
                   which adaptation is possible. They also demonstrate
                   that the role predators play in structuring this
                   ecosystem resembles many others studied from a more
                   purely ecological perspective; in these streams, as
                   elsewhere, predators depress the numbers of
                   individuals in prey species which in turn reduces the
                   effects of the prey species on other trophic levels
                   and hence the structure of the ecosystem. A focus on
                   predators is important in conservation biology
                   because predators are often the organisms that are
                   most susceptible to local extinction. Their selective
                   loss occurs because large predators have been
                   deliberately exterminated and/or are more susceptible
                   to environmental disturbances. Furthermore, we will
                   argue that predator re-introductions might be
                   destabilizing if, in the absence of predators, their
                   prey have evolved in a fashion that makes them highly
                   susceptible to predation, even after time intervals
                   as short as 50-100 years. A better understanding of
                   the evolutionary impacts of top predators will be
                   critical goal for the policy and practice of large
                   carnivore restoration in the future.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Controlling vertebrate predators is one
                   of the most widespread forms of wildlife management
                   and it continues to cause conflict between
                   stakeholders worldwide. It is important for managers
                   and policy-makers to make decisions on this issue
                   that are based on the best available scientific
                   evidence. Therefore, it is first important to
                   understand if there is indeed an impact of vertebrate
                   predators on prey, and then to quantify this impact.
                   METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using the UK as a
                   case study, we use a meta-analytical approach to
                   review the available evidence to assess the effect of
                   vertebrate predation on animal prey abundance. We
                   find a significant effect of predators on prey
                   abundance across our studies. On average, there is a
                   1.6 fold increase in prey abundance in the absence of
                   predation. However, we show significant heterogeneity
                   in effect sizes, and discuss how the method of
                   predator control, whether the predator is native or
                   non-native, and aspects of study design, may be
                   potential causes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our
                   results allow some cautious policy recommendations to
                   be made regarding the management of predator and prey
                   populations. Meta-analysis is an important tool for
                   understanding general patterns in the effect of
                   predators on prey abundance across studies. Such an
                   approach is especially valuable where management
                   decisions need to be made in the absence of
                   site-specific information.},

                   bottom-up control of ecosystems remains a
                   controversial issue, with debate often focusing on
                   the perennial question of how predators affect prey
                   densities. To assess predator impacts, we performed a
                   worldwide meta-analysis of field experiments in which
                   the densities of terrestrial vertebrate predators
                   were manipulated and the responses of their
                   terrestrial vertebrate prey were measured. Our
                   results show that predation indeed limits prey
                   populations, as prey densities change substantially
                   after predator manipulations. The main determinant of
                   the result of an experiment was the efficiency of
                   predator manipulation. Positive impacts of predator
                   manipulation appeared to increase with duration of
                   the experiment for non-cyclic prey, while the
                   opposite was true for cyclic prey. In addition,
                   predator manipulation showed a large positive impact
                   on cyclic prey at low prey densities, but had no
                   obvious impact at peak prey densities. As prey
                   population densities generally respond predictably to
                   predator manipula- tions, we suggest that control of
                   introduced vertebrate predators can be used to
                   effectively conserve and manage native wildlife.
                   However, care should be taken when controlling native
                   predators, especially apex species, owing to their
                   importance as strong interactors and the biodiversity
                   value of their habitats. We discuss gaps in our
                   knowledge of predator–prey relationships and
                   methodological issues related to manipulation
                   experiments. An important guideline for future
                   studies is that adequate monitoring of predator
                   numbers before and during the experiment is the only
                   way to ensure that observed responses in prey
                   populations are actually caused by changes in
                   predation impacts.},

                   changes caused by humans which affect the
                   relationships between predatory and prey species. In
                   both game management for harvesting, and in species
                   preservation, this leads to difficult decisions about
                   whether and how to manage predation. Predator control
                   by humans is as old as livestock husbandry. The
                   deliberate, often organized, destruction of many
                   mammalian predator species has been a feature of
                   human development in Europe - and later in countries
                   to which Europeans spread - for centuries.
                   Destruction to the point of extinction was practised
                   for a number of reasons (self-protection, protection
                   of domestic stock, protection of wild game, fur,
                   adventure, sport) which were rarely distinguished.
                   Reduction of predator numbers specifically to allow
                   an increased harvest of some game species was mainly
                   a nineteenth century development, while the adoption
                   of predator control to benefit endangered species for
                   their own sake belongs to recent decades. We review
                   scientific literature relevant to predator control in
                   game management and in conservation. Understanding of
                   the role of predation in prey population dynamics has
                   changed considerably during the last 20 years, and
                   predation is now credited with a much more powerful
                   role than in the past. Increasingly it becomes
                   possible not merely to understand what predator
                   control achieves, but to predict when it might be
                   valuable in management, and what strategy will best
                   achieve the aims. Examples of conservation problems
                   involving predation illustrate the complexity of
                   decisionmaking in management. Because of habitat
                   loss, habitat degradation, altered predator
                   communities, or altered predator-prey ratios,
                   predation losses often have increased significance in
                   modern environments. Novel approaches potentially
                   offer non-lethal ways to manage mammalian predators.
                   However, most are still in an exploratory phase and
                   there have been no unqualified successes. The best
                   tested approach, excluding predators from small areas
                   by fencing, is discussed. In Britain, predator
                   control to benefit small game populations and allow
                   harvesting has been practised for nearly 200 years,
                   and has undoubtedly played a role in shaping the
                   present-day fauna. Although earlier gamekeeping
                   severely reduced the geographical range of several
                   mammalian (and avian) predator species, nowadays
                   predator control is subject to legal restrictions
                   based on species' conservation status and humaneness.
                   However, illegal persecution of species protected by
                   law remains a persistent and significant conservation
                   problem. The predator species legitimately targeted
                   are successful, common and increasing in the modem
                   environment, while wild populations of gamebirds and
                   many other ground-nesting birds are declining
                   seriously in most areas.},

                   species has made predator control an important issue
                   for international nature conservation. Predator
                   removal by culling or translocation is controversial,
                   expensive, and time-consuming, and results are often
                   temporary. Thus, it is important to assess its
                   effectiveness from all available evidence. We used
                   explicit systematic review methodology to determine
                   the impact of predator removal on four measurable
                   responses in birds: breeding performance (hatching
                   success and fledging success) and population size
                   (breeding and postbreeding). We used meta-analysis to
                   summarize results from 83 predator removal studies
                   from six continents. We also investigated whether
                   characteristics of the prey, predator species,
                   location, and study methodology explained
                   heterogeneity in effect sizes. Removing predators
                   increased hatching success, fledging success, and
                   breeding populations. Removing all predator species
                   achieved a significantly larger increase in breeding
                   population than removing only a subset. Postbreeding
                   population size was not improved on islands, or
                   overall, but did increase on mainlands. Heterogeneity
                   in effect sizes for the four population parameters
                   was not explained by whether predators were native or
                   introduced; prey were declining, migratory, or game
                   species; or by the study methodology. Effect sizes
                   for fledging success were smaller for ground-nesting
                   birds than those that nest elsewhere, but the
                   difference was not significant. We conclude that
                   current evidence indicates that predator removal is
                   an effective strategy for the conservation of
                   vulnerable bird populations. Nevertheless, the
                   ethical and practical problems associated with
                   predator removal may lead managers to favor
                   alternative, nonlethal solutions. Research is needed
                   to provide and synthesize data to determine whether
                   these are effective management practices for future
                   policies on bird conservation.},

                   that one or more species are pre-adapted to new
                   conditions, which restricts the ecological
                   opportunity for evolutionary responses in all the
                   species. Consequently, environmental change tends to
                   select for changes in species abundances rather than
                   for changing phenotypes within each species. The
                   buffering effects of species diversity that we
                   describe might be one important but neglected
                   explanation for widely observed niche conservatism in
                   natural systems. Furthermore, the results show that
                   attempts to understand biotic responses to
                   environmental change need to consider both ecological
                   and evolutionary processes in a realistically diverse
                   setting.},

  abstract =      {The role and importance of ecological interactions
                   for evolutionary responses to environmental changes
                   is to large extent unknown. Here it is shown that
                   interspecific competition may slow down rates of
                   adaptation substantially and fundamentally change
                   patterns of adaptation to long-term environmental
                   changes. In the model investigated here, species
                   compete for resources distributed along an ecological
                   niche space. Environmental change is represented by a
                   slowly moving resource maximum and evolutionary
                   responses of single species are compared with
                   responses of coalitions of two and three competing
                   species. In scenarios with two and three species,
                   species that are favored by increasing resource
                   availability increase in equilibrium population size
                   whereas disfavored species decline in size. Increased
                   competition makes it less favorable for individuals
                   of a disfavored species to occupy a niche close to
                   the maximum and reduces the selection pressure for
                   tracking the moving resource distribution.
                   Individual-based simulations and an analysis using
                   adaptive dynamics show that the combination of weaker
                   selection pressure and reduced population size
                   reduces the evolutionary rate of the disfavored
                   species considerably. If the resource landscape moves
                   stochastically, weak evolutionary responses cause
                   large fluctuations in population size and thereby
                   large extinction risk for competing species, whereas
                   a single species subject to the same environmental
                   variability may track the resource maximum closely
                   and maintain a much more stable population size.
                   Other studies have shown that competitive
                   interactions may amplify changes in mean population
                   sizes due to environmental changes and thereby
                   increase extinction risks. This study accentuates the
                   harmful role of competitive interactions by
                   illustrating that they may also decrease rates of
                   adaptation. The slowdown in evolutionary rates caused
                   by competition may also contribute to explain low
                   rates of morphological change in spite of large
                   environmental fluctuations found in fossil records.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that environmental
                   changes may tip the balance between interacting
                   species, leading to the extinction of one or more
                   species. While it is recognized that evolution will
                   play a role in determining how environmental changes
                   directly affect species, the interactions among
                   species force us to consider the coevolutionary
                   responses of species to environmental changes.
                   METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We use simple models
                   of competition, predation, and mutualism to organize
                   and synthesize the ways coevolution modifies species
                   interactions when climatic changes favor one species
                   over another. In cases where species have conflicting
                   interests (i.e., selection for increased
                   interspecific interaction strength on one species is
                   detrimental to the other), we show that coevolution
                   reduces the effects of climate change, leading to
                   smaller changes in abundances and reduced chances of
                   extinction. Conversely, when species have
                   nonconflicting interests (i.e., selection for
                   increased interspecific interaction strength on one
                   species benefits the other), coevolution increases
                   the effects of climate change.
                   CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Coevolution sets up
                   feedback loops that either dampen or amplify the
                   effect of environmental change on species abundances
                   depending on whether coevolution has conflicting or
                   nonconflicting effects on species interactions. Thus,
                   gaining a better understanding of the coevolutionary
                   processes between interacting species is critical for
                   understanding how communities respond to a changing
                   climate. We suggest experimental methods to determine
                   which types of coevolution (conflicting or
                   nonconflicting) drive species interactions, which
                   should lead to better understanding of the effects of
                   coevolution on species adaptation. Conducting these
                   experiments across environmental gradients will test
                   our predictions of the effects of environmental
                   change and coevolution on ecological communities.},

                   change mainly due to human activities. The unusual
                   rate and extent of anthropogenic alterations of the
                   environment may exceed the capacity of developmental,
                   genetic, and demographic mechanisms that populations
                   have evolved to deal with environmental change. To
                   begin to understand the limits to population
                   persistence, we present a simple evolutionary model
                   for the critical rate of environmental change beyond
                   which a population must decline and go extinct. We
                   use this model to highlight the major determinants of
                   extinction risk in a changing environment, and
                   identify research needs for improved predictions
                   based on projected changes in environmental
                   variables. Two key parameters relating the
                   environment to population biology have not yet
                   received sufficient attention. Phenotypic plasticity,
                   the direct influence of environment on the
                   development of individual phenotypes, is increasingly
                   considered an important component of phenotypic
                   change in the wild and should be incorporated in
                   models of population persistence. Environmental
                   sensitivity of selection, the change in the optimum
                   phenotype with the environment, still crucially needs
                   empirical assessment. We use environmental tolerance
                   curves and other examples of ecological and
                   evolutionary responses to climate change to
                   illustrate how these mechanistic approaches can be

                   conservation context to predict the fate of small or
                   declining populations. Persistence models have
                   explored effects on extinction of random demographic
                   and environmental fluctuations, but in the face of
                   directional environmental change they should also
                   integrate factors affecting whether a population can
                   adapt. Here, we examine the population-size
                   dependence of demographic and genetic factors and
                   their likely contributions to extinction time under
                   scenarios of environmental change. Parameter
                   estimates were derived from experimental populations
                   of the rainforest species, Drosophila birchii, held
                   in the lab for 10 generations at census sizes of 20,
                   100 and 1000, and later exposed to five generations
                   of heat-knockdown selection. Under a model of
                   directional change in the thermal environment, rapid
                   extinction of populations of size 20 was caused by a
                   combination of low growth rate (r) and high
                   stochasticity in r. Populations of 100 had
                   significantly higher reproductive output, lower
                   stochasticity in r and more additive genetic variance
                   (V(A)) than populations of 20, but they were
                   predicted to persist less well than the largest size
                   class. Even populations of 1000 persisted only a few
                   hundred generations under realistic estimates of
                   environmental change because of low V(A) for
                   heat-knockdown resistance. The experimental results
                   document population-size dependence of demographic
                   and adaptability factors. The simulations illustrate
                   a threshold influence of demographic factors on
                   population persistence, while genetic variance has a

  abstract =      {The phenomenon of a population increasing in response
                   to an increase in its per-capita mortality rate has
                   recently been termed the 'hydra effect'. This article
                   reviews and unifies previous work on this phenomenon.
                   Some discrete models of density-dependent growth were
                   shown to exhibit hydra effects in 1954, but the topic
                   was then ignored for decades. Here the history of
                   research on the hydra effect is reviewed, and the key
                   factors producing it are explored. Mortality that
                   precedes overcompensatory density dependence always
                   has the potential to produce hydra effects. Even when
                   mortality follows density dependence, hydra effects
                   may occur in unstable systems due to changes in the
                   amplitude and/or form of population cycles. An
                   increase in resource productivity due to lower
                   consumption rates following increased consumer
                   mortality can also produce a hydra effect. Lower
                   consumption can come about as the result of increased
                   satiation of the consumers or changes in behaviour of
                   either consumer or resource species that reduce the
                   mean attack rate. Changes in species composition of a
                   resource community may also decrease the average
                   attack rate. Population structure can promote hydra
                   effects by allowing separation of the timing of
                   density dependence and mortality, although
                   stage-specific density dependence usually decreases
                   hydra effects.},

  abstract =      {Populations facing novel environments can persist by
                   adapting. In nature, the ability to adapt and persist
                   will depend on interactions between coexisting
                   individuals. Here we use an adaptive dynamic model to
                   assess how the potential for evolutionary rescue is
                   affected by intra- and interspecific competition.
                   Intraspecific competition (negative
                   density-dependence) lowers abundance, which decreases
                   the supply rate of beneficial mutations, hindering
                   evolutionary rescue. On the other hand, interspecific
                   competition can aid evolutionary rescue when it
                   speeds adaptation by increasing the strength of
                   selection. Our results clarify this point and give an
                   additional requirement: competition must increase
                   selection pressure enough to overcome the negative
                   effect of reduced abundance. We therefore expect
                   evolutionary rescue to be most likely in communities
                   which facilitate rapid niche displacement. Our model,
                   which aligns to previous quantitative and population
                   genetic models in the absence of competition,
                   provides a first analysis of when competitors should
                   help or hinder evolutionary rescue.},

                   and iteroparity (reproducing more than once in a
                   lifetime) has led to many questions investigating the
                   evolution or persistence of these strategies. Here we
                   investigate semelparity and iteroparity for their
                   evolutionary importance. A mathematical model is used
                   to illustrate how a population's ability to evolve
                   depends on this life-history trait, and how this rate
                   of evolution impacts the individual. We find that the
                   ability of a trait to evolve is greater toward a
                   semelparous strategy and this expresses a fitness
                   advantage. This leads to an optimality between
                   survival, population tracking ability, and lifetime

                   homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic
                   approach regards the time evolution as a continuous,
                   wholly predictable process which is governed by a set
                   of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the
                   “reaction-rate equations”); the stochastic
                   approach regards the time evolution as a kind of
                   random-walk process which is governed by a single
                   dif- ferential-difference equation (the “master
                   equation”). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments
                   show that the stochastic formulation of chemical
                   kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the
                   deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the
                   stochastic master equation is often mathematically
                   intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact
                   numerical calculations within the framework of the
                   stochastic formulation without having to deal with
                   the master equation directly. It is a relatively
                   simple digital computer algorithm which uses a
                   rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to
                   numerically simulate the time evolution of the given
                   chemical system. Like the master equation, this
                   “stochastic simulation algorithm” correctly
                   accounts for the inherent fluctuations and
                   correlations that are necessarily ignored in the
                   deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most
                   procedures for numerically solving the deterministic
                   reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never
                   approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by
                   finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of
                   the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying
                   it to several well-known model chemical systems,
                   including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the
                   Oregonator.},
